# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
### Background
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
### Purpose
Use the skills I have learned through Pandas and Python to run an analysis on s school district for 9th grade reading and math scores.  This will provide the school board with information on where the district may be seeing academic dishonesty along with giving them data to help in future decision making.

## Results









## Summary
* School spending summary was not impacted.
* The average math and reading scores were not impacted.
* Overall, 6% decrease in overall passing in the $630 - $644 spending range.
* The passing percentages overall decreased by about 3% post data change.
